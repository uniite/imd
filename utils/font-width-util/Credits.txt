A good part of the oled code was taken from http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=3808&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=oled&start=15 , including the main font, the code for the fonts, and the basis of the oled.h definitions.
Big thanks go out to KamPutty of SparkFun.com Forums
Also thanks to SparkFun, and the people who wrote the Gumstix GPIO and SPI examples (see gpio.c and spi.c)
